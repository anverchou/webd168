            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Anver Chou and I am a second year student at Mesa College. I am currently majoring in Mathematics and Pre-Engineering.
                I am hoping to transfer to UCSD for Mathematics/CS or UCI for Software Engineering this fall. I think something interesting that I do is that
                I help tutor students from K-6 in tech. I teach various lessons ranging from robtics, scratch, python, and more, depending on grade of the students for 
                a specific class.

            <h2>About This Course</h2>
            <p>I am taking this course because I want to learn more about HTML and CSS. I am also interested in learning more about frontend development
                Through this course, I am hoping to improve my programming skills and knowledge. By improving my programming skills and knowledge, I hope to obtain
                a career in tech. 
            </p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I have taken a multiude of courses related to programming at Mesa. Python, C++, Java, Data Strucutres and Algorithms are a few of the classes
                I have taken so far. I have had some prior experience with web design, learning HTML and CSS from my APCS classes in high school and doing some self learning over the summer.
                However, I would say my experience in web design and frontend development is still very novice, thus, this is why I am taking this course.
