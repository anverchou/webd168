                <p>Hello! My name is Anver Chou, and I am a second-year student at Mesa College. I am currently majoring in Mathematics and Pre-Engineering. I will be transferring to UCI this fall for Software Engineering. I also tutor students from K-6 in tech, teaching various lessons ranging from robotics, Scratch, Python, and more.

                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>I have taken many programming-related courses at Mesa, including Python, C++, Java, and Data Structures. My prior experience with web design stems from high school APCS classes and self-learning over the summer. However, I still consider my web design experience novice, which is why I am taking this course.</p>
